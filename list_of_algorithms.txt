One potential answer to this question comes from the Analytics 1305 [2] documentation:
Kernel Density Estimation and Non-parametric Bayes Classifier
K-Means
Kernel Principal Components Analysis
Linear Regression
Neighbors (Nearest, Farthest, Range, k, Classification)
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
Support Vector Machines
Dimensionality Reduction
Fast Singular Value Decomposition
Decision Tree
Bootstapped SVM

The 11 algorithms implemented by 11Ants [1] provide another potential answer for this question:
Decision Tree
Gaussian Processes
Logistic Regression
Logit Boost
Model Tree
Naïve Bayes
Nearest Neighbors
PLS
Random Forest
Ridge Regression
Support Vector Machine

Another potential answer comes from the algorithms in Oracle Data Mining [3]
Classification: logistic regression, naïve bayes, SVM, decision tree
Regression: multiple regression, SVM
Attribute importance: MDL
Anomaly detection: one-class SVM
Clustering: k-means, orthogonal partitioning
Association: A Priori
Feature extraction: NNMF

Note: I don't personally endorse these choices, or even naming conventions. Just thought it made for another useful list.

================================================================================================

Linear regression
Logistic regression

Random Forests
Matrix Factorization/SVD
Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Machines
Naive Bayes
Artificial Neural Networks
For the last one I'd let you pick one of the following:
Bayesian Networks
Elastic Nets
Any other clustering algo besides k-means
LDA
Conditional Random Fields
HDPs or other Bayesian non-parametric model


=================================================================================================
SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps
